# hello-world
First repository
My name is Shawn Jackson. I am currently 17 years old and am graduating high school in one month. I'm learning how to use GitHub in hopes to become more involved in the Programming community, as well as start beginning on my own personal projects to upload and share with the world.
These changes are made to describe a bit about myself.
